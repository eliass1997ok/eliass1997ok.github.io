					<h2>Hackathon AngelHack-BCI</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">June 2018</p>
					<p>I was part of the winner team on the AngelHack-BCI hackathon. We presented a project that satisfied the actual problems on the social media area of the BCI bank. This platform allows the bank to be more efficient on the process between bank executives and the small companies.</p>

					<h2>ACM-ICPC Competitions</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">November 2017 & November 2018</p>
					<p>In 2017 I participated in my first programming competition, called "Torneo Chileno de Programación" (Chilean Programming Contest). My team and me, without preparation, obtained a good place in the competitions. My university called us to represent them into the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) in november. There we obtained the nineteenth place. </p>
					<p>In 2018 we participated on Valdivia city, on our first travel outside Santiago as a team. We solved more problems in comparison with our previous tries, but again, we didn’t won, although, we learned a lot.</p>
					<p>In 2019 we participated, this time with a different team, in Concepción city. Maybe we should be disappointed that we didn't win the competition. However, every year we feel better working as a team, we are more organized in doing so, and we are already starting to notice our different skills on different kinds of problems. We already know who is good at solving dynamic programming problems, algorithms, etc. I'm good at data structures. I'm happy with our work.</p>

					<h2>Facebook Hackathon</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">April 2018 & March 2019</p>
					<p>In April 2018, I participated in my first hackathon, organized by Facebook. There, with my team we created a prototype of a webpage that his purpose was transform formatted text into Google presentations in order to speed up the process of creating simple and minimalist presentations. We didn't have a good place in the hackathon, but there I learned a lot, and I enjoyed it a lot.</p>
					<p>In March 2019, I had my second experience on a Facebook Hackathon, but due to medical problems with the team, we couldn’t present our project. Anyways, we will present it on another opportunity.</p>

					<h2>Udemy Instructor</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">March 2020</p>
					<p>My love of teaching is no mystery to anyone. I have always liked to share my knowledge, not because I think I am superior, but because I believe that all knowledge, even if it is little, should be taught. This is why, in December 2019, and given the free time that the Chilean social crisis left me, I decided to become an Udemy instructor, which became a reality in March 2020, when I finished recording my course, and finally published it. It is a course of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentos-de-programacion-desde-cero-programacion-en-c/?referralCode=85F399B1FC69A73962E4">programming fundamentals, oriented to C</a>. I plan to continue doing courses from now on, since teaching, is one of my great passions.</p>
